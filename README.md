# PathfinderAI

**PathfinderAI** is a specialized AI-powered programming tutor designed as part of a high school project. Conceived with a company and brand image in mind, PathfinderAI serves as a knowledgeable guide for students and aspiring programmers—offering code explanations, examples, and tailored assistance in a user-friendly interface.

## Project Concept

The idea behind PathfinderAI is to act as a virtual mentor, guiding users through programming concepts and coding challenges. The AI assistant is driven by DeepSeek as its backend, enhanced with custom instructions to provide educational and insightful responses. The name "Pathfinder" reflects its purpose: to help users find their way through the world of programming.
